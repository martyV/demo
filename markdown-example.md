# Markdown example

## Bold & italics
Markdown makes it especially easy to create bold and italicized text. Only asterisks are required to this end.    
To write in italics, add an asterisk before and after the word or words.    
For bold text, use two asterisks – and if you want a text to be both bold and italicized, three asterisks are necessary.    
Alternatively, you can use underscores.
```
*Italic Text*
_Italic Text_
**Bold Text**
__Bold Text__
***Italic and Bold Text***
___Italic and Bold Text___
```
*Italic Text*    
_Italic Text_     
**Bold Text**     
__Bold Text__     
***Italic and Bold Text***    
___Italic and Bold Text___    

## Strikethroughs
In order to create a crossed-out text, use the tilde in Markdown twice in a row, followed by the respective text and then another two tildes.
```
~~This text is struckthrough.~~ This one isn’t.
```
~~This text is struckthrough.~~ This one isn’t.
## Headings

To create a heading in Markdown, a pound sign is typically used.    
It’s inserted with a space before the corresponding text. To create headings that are lower in the hierarchy and thus smaller,    
extra pound signs are added. This enables up to six levels of headings, just like in HTML.
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Paragraphs
The Markdown language works with hard line breaks to separate paragraphs from each other. To create a completely new block of text (

tag), simply add an empty line.  
Important note:    
for Markdown, it’s sufficient if the line is visually empty. So if the line contains white spaces like tabs or spaces,    
the parser will ignore them and consider the line to be empty. 
If you want to create a line break like the tag, add two spaces at the end of a line.

## Quotes
In Markdown, quotes in a certain part of the text are indicated using a blockquote element. The greater-than sign is used for this purpose (>).    
You have the option to either mark each individual line with this sign or to insert it only at the beginning of the paragraph and to end  
the indented passage with an empty line. Additional formatting elements are possible in the blockquote element.
```
>This is an **embedded section**.
>The section continues here
```
>This is another **embedded section**.
This section also continues in the second like

This line isn’t embedded any more.

## Lists
To create an unsorted list in Markdown, you can use either the plus sign, the hyphen or an asterisk. All three ways produce the same result.
```
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3
```
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3
- Point 3
Conversely, a sorted list is generated by a number directly followed by a period.
```
1. Point 1
2. Point 2
3. Point 3
```
1. Point 1
2. Point 2
3. Point 3

Markdown also gives you the option of creating checklists. These appear with a box that can be activated by clicking on it.  
You can also add a checkmark when creating the list. To do so, insert square brackets and an X.

## Code

To mark a text as code in Markdown, a backtick – also known as an accent grave – is used (not to be confused with a simple quotation mark). The text is marked with a backtick at the start and end of the relevant passage. This enables source code or software commands to be incorporated directly into the running text.
```
This is `code`.
```
This is `code`.

If a backtick is used in your code example itself, you can also use the sign twice at the beginning of the code section.  
In this case, Markdown will not interpret the simple backtick as an instruction.
```
``This is all `code`.``
```
``This is all `code`.``    
To mark an entire block as source code, you can either use a tab or four spaces – for each line. You can indent the selected lines further by adding more tabs or spaces.
```
This is normal, continuous text.
  This is the first line of the code block.
     The second line is further indented.
  This is another line of code block.
This is where continuous text begins again.
```
This is normal, continuous text.
  This is the first line of the code block.
     The second line is further indented.
  This is another line of code block.
This is where continuous text begins again.    
If you’d prefer to use signs to start and end code blocks, you can also mark the corresponding passage with three backticks at the start and at the end.     Here you also have the option – at least with many Markdown editors – to create color highlights automatically.    
To do so, enter the language of the following source code after the three introductory backticks.
```
```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
</html>
```
```
```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
</html>
```
## Images & hyperlinks
Markdown can likewise be used to integrate images and hyperlinks in your text. Both are created with a combination of square and round brackets.    
You can generate a link by placing the anchor text – i.e. the words or phrases visible in the text – in square brackets and inserting the URL in round brackets directly afterwards.  
If you’d like to give the hyperlink an optional title that the user can see in the mouseover, this is also possible:    
Enter the text in the round brackets, separated from the URL with a space and put in double quotation marks.
```
Here is a [Link](https://example.com/ "Optional link title").
```
Here is a [Link](https://example.com/ "Optional link title").

If you want to include a URL or an email address in the normal running text, most Markdown editors automatically create a clickable hyperlink.    
But to make sure this happens, you can insert a less-than and greater-than sign. To prevent this automatic editor feature, however, you should mark the URL as code and use backticks again.

<https://example.com>
`https://example.com`

As with hyperlinks, images can also be added to the Markdown document. To add images, start with an exclamation mark. Afterwards again insert square brackets which contain the alternative text for the image and round brackets with the image URL. This is then directly displayed in the text.

```
![Here is an example](https://example.com/bild.jpg)
```
Images and hyperlinks can also be combined. To create a clickable link behind an image, you can nest the two functions together.    
In this case, the image becomes the anchor text and thus appears in the square brackets.
```
[![Here is an example image](https://example.com/image.jpg)](https://example.com)
```
[![Here is an example image](https://example.com/image.jpg)](https://example.com)

## Tables

Pipes (|) allow tables to be drawn in Markdown. Each cell is separated by a pipe.   
To create the header rows that are visually distinct from the rest of the content, you highlight the corresponding cells with hyphens.
```
|Column 1|Column 2|
|--------|--------|
|    A    |    B    |
|    C    |    D    |
```
|Column 1|Column 2|
|--------|--------|
|    A    |    B    |
|    C    |    D    |

In principle, it’s not important that the pipes are located one below the other. This only increases the readability when the Markdown document is viewed in its raw version. The same applies to pipes located to the side. These are likewise inconsequential for the compiling process.

## Footnotes

Markdown gives you the option of inserting footnotes. You can write a reference number in the running text and link to the footnote at the end of the page – a corresponding line is created automatically. The reference number is also formatted as a hyperlink. Clicking on it leads directly to the relevant footnote. To use this automatic function, you should first insert the reference number after the respective word. In square brackets, you first write a circumflex and then the number.

The number you use (other terms are also possible) does not matter. Just like when creating lists, Markdown automatically performs the counting for you. However, it’s important that you correctly link to the reference again for the footnote. Add the same number to a new line with a circumflex in a bracket, insert a colon and then write the actual footnote. It can also be fully formatted and encompass multiple lines.
```
You can easily place footnotes [^2] in the continuous text [^1].
[^1]: Here you can find the text for the footnote.
[^2]: **Footnotes** themselves can also be *formatted*.
And these even include several lines.

## & and <>

Since Markdown is closely related to HTML, the “and” symbol as well as the less-than and greater-than sign deserve special attention.    
These signs are used in HTML to open and close tags (<>) or to work with entities (&). But if you want to use the signs for their original purpose, they have to be masked in HTML: &, < and >. In general, there’s no reason in Markdown why you can’t use the signs “as they are”. However, since users have the possibility of mixing up Markdown with HTML, this is more complicated in practice. The parser understands when you want the simple characters and when you want HTML code so you don’t need to solve this problem yourself.
```
A & B
&alpha;
1 < 2
<p>
```
A & B
&alpha;
1 < 2
<p>

## Backslash masking

Besides the specific characters involved in HTML, Markdown also uses certain symbols as markups. When you insert them, the parser will respond to them during conversion.    
This pertains to the following signs:

* Asterisk: *
* Hyphen: -
* Underscore: _
* Round brackets: ()
* Square brackets: []
* Curly brackets: {}
* Period: .
* Exclamation mark: !
* Pound: #
* Accent grave: `
* Backslash: \
To use these signs for their original purpose, simply add a backslash in front of them. Important: The backslash must be entered before each individual sign, i.e. before an opening bracket and before a closing bracket.
```
This is an \*example with an asterisk\*.
