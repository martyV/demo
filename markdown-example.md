# Markdown example

## Bold & italics
Markdown makes it especially easy to create bold and italicized text. Only asterisks are required to this end.    
To write in italics, add an asterisk before and after the word or words.    
For bold text, use two asterisks – and if you want a text to be both bold and italicized, three asterisks are necessary.    
Alternatively, you can use underscores.
```
*Italic Text*
_Italic Text_
**Bold Text**
__Bold Text__
***Italic and Bold Text***
___Italic and Bold Text___
```
*Italic Text*    
_Italic Text_     
**Bold Text**     
__Bold Text__     
***Italic and Bold Text***    
___Italic and Bold Text___    

## Strikethroughs
In order to create a crossed-out text, use the tilde in Markdown twice in a row, followed by the respective text and then another two tildes.
```
~~This text is struckthrough.~~ This one isn’t.
```
~~This text is struckthrough.~~ This one isn’t.
## Headings

To create a heading in Markdown, a pound sign is typically used.    
It’s inserted with a space before the corresponding text. To create headings that are lower in the hierarchy and thus smaller,    
extra pound signs are added. This enables up to six levels of headings, just like in HTML.
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Paragraphs
The Markdown language works with hard line breaks to separate paragraphs from each other. To create a completely new block of text (

tag), simply add an empty line.  
Important note:    
for Markdown, it’s sufficient if the line is visually empty. So if the line contains white spaces like tabs or spaces,    
the parser will ignore them and consider the line to be empty. 
If you want to create a line break like the tag, add two spaces at the end of a line.
